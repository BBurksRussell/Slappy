I have a few different website that I control and edit:

The first one is my personal blog. <a href="http://bburksrussell.wordpress.com/"> http://bburksrussell.wordpress.com</a>
It is hosted on wordpress and I currently use the theme: ChaoticSoul by Bryan Veloso.

The second is a subreddit that I moderate called <a href="http://reddit.com/r/shovelbums">r/shovelbums</a>.
